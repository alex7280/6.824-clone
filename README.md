This is my own implementation of the 6.824, MIT's Distributed Systems course. I work on these projects in order to learn how to program in golang and learn distributed systems. The four projects are: 1. MapReduce 2. RAFT 3. Fault Tolerant KV store 4. Shared KV store. I have finished
project 1 and finishing up project 2.
